- **Batch Operations**: Implemented efficient batch preference updates

#### Key Features Implemented:
```java
// Thread-safe read operations
public static boolean getBool(@NonNull String key, boolean def) {
    if (!isInitialized() || key == null) return def;
    readLock.lock();
    try {
        return instance.getBoolean(key, def);
    } catch (Exception e) {
        Log.e(TAG, "Error getting boolean for key: " + key, e);
        return def;
    } finally {
        readLock.unlock();
    }
}

// ANR recovery mechanism
public static void recoverFromANR() {
    Log.w(TAG, "Attempting ANR recovery for AppPreference");
    writeLock.lock();
    try {
        if (instance != null) {
            instance.contains("test_key");
            Log.i(TAG, "AppPreference ANR recovery successful");
        }
    } catch (Exception e) {
